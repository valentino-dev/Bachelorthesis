\section{Introduction}
The hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theory was first regarded as to costly for reasonable calculations. With the upcomming of quantum computers, we now expect a significant speedup of calculations that can be representet with states. The use of entanglement of these states promisses an exponential speedup. This fact moves the hamiltonian formulation in a point of interest again. For that reason we will revisit this formulation and implement the theory on a classical computer.

I aim to give a good introduction such that other new students of the field will have condensed understanding. The setup will be in the compact U(1) theory, truncated appropiately and reduced from complete configuration space to a physical configuration space with Gauss's Law.

For the numerical results we will take a look at the expectation value for the plaquette operator and finaly calculate the $q\bar{q}$ potential.
