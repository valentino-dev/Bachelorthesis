\section{Outlook}
Following the analysis of this work, the next step is to determine the running coupling, via e.g. the step scaling approach.\cite{crippa2024}

Furthermore the unit scale of the calculated quantities should be determined. Unfortunately this is not really possible for this $(2+1)$ dimensional system, since we need to match experimental data which is measured in the real world within a $(3+1)$ dimensional field theory.

To give the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theory a future, where it can be used for larger lattices, the theory needs to be implemented on a quantum computer.\cite{crippa2024} The theory can also be implemented using tensor networks.\cite{wu2025accurategaugeinvarianttensornetwork, Singh_2011}

However the Hamiltonian formulation will be implemented, it is a necessery tool for computations, where so far the dominent method of MCMC simulations of the Lagrangian formulation has the sign problem. \cite{Garofalo:2024VV}
