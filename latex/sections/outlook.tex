\section{Outlook}
Following the analysis of this work, the next step is to determine the running coupling, via e.g. the step scaling approach.\cite{crippa2024}

Furthermore the unit scale of the calculated quantities should be determined. Unfortunately this is not really possible for this two dimensional system, since we need to match experimental data which is measured in the real world within a 4 dimensional field theory.

To give the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theory a future, where it can be used for larger lattices, the theory needs to be implemented on a quantum computer.\cite{crippa2024} The theory can also be implemented using tensor networks.\cite{wu2025accurategaugeinvarianttensornetwork, Singh_2011}
