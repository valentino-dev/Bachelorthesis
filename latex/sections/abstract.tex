	\section{Abstract}
  For this work, a lattice will be constructed in the compact U(1) theory within pure gauge. It will give an insight in the implementation using \texttt{Python}.
  One intention of this work is to give a good introduction such that other new students of the compact U(1) theory will have a better understanding and intuition. The setup will be truncated appropriately and reduced from the complete configuration space to a physical configuration space through Gauss's Law.
	For the numerical results, the expectation value for the plaquette operator and the $q\bar{q}$ potential is determined. For the latter, confinement will be shown. Furthermore the variation of the lattice properties, such as truncation $l$, coupling $g$ and positioning of the quarks will be discussed.
