              Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use,

              characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library

              architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a
              discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide
              additional examples and further outline details of the architecture
              and features of SymPy. },

  abstract = {Lattice gauge theories, which originated from particle physics in
              the context of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), provide an important
              intellectual stimulus to further develop quantum information
              technologies. While one long-term goal is the reliable quantum
              simulation of currently intractable aspects of QCD itself, lattice
              gauge theories also play an important role in condensed matter
              physics and in quantum information science. In this way, lattice
              gauge theories provide both motivation and a framework for
              interdisciplinary research towards the development of special
              purpose digital and analog quantum simulators, and ultimately of
              scalable universal quantum computers. In this manuscript, recent
              results and new tools from a quantum science approach to study
              lattice gauge theories are reviewed. Two new complementary
              approaches are discussed: first, tensor network methods are
              presented -- a classical simulation approach -- applied to the
              study of lattice gauge theories together with some results on
              Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Then, recent
              proposals for the implementation of lattice gauge theory quantum
              simulators in different quantum hardware are reported, e.g.,
              trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, and superconducting circuits. Finally,
              the first proof-of-principle trapped ions experimental quantum
              simulations of the Schwinger model are reviewed.},
